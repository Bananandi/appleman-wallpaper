# appleman-wallpaper
A Python program for discovering the Mandelbrot Set and to create Wallpapers from it.
The visual representation was created with matplotlib.

The apple_man.py script is a minimal version that just displays the Mandelbrot Set within the specified limits.

The apple_man_pro.py script has the following additional functionalities:
- Repaint with low resolution (to explor the apple man): In the matplotlib window select a subset of the image by clicking the lens symbol -> press "a"
- Repaint in the desired format: Select a subset -> press "b" (specified as constant)
- Save the image: Press "c" and choose a location

Here are some output examples:
